Ultrarathon Data Analysis Project
  This project takes a dataset from Kaggle on ultramarathon races and demonstrates my ability to clean, organize, and visualize data, with the goal of drawing meaningful conclusions.
  It showcases my proficiency in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis.

Project Overview:
  Data Source: Ultrarathon dataset from Kaggle
  Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Microsoft PowerPoint
  
Process:
  Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and removed outliers.
  Data Organization: Structured the dataset for easy analysis, grouped by key categories such as race length and season.
  Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to explore trends, comparisons, and performance metrics across different races and seasons.
  Presentation: Summarized the findings and created a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint to effectively communicate the key insights.
  
This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply data cleaning techniques, create visualizations, and draw actionable insights â€” key skills required for data analyst roles.
